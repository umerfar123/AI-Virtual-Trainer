# AI Trainer

# Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, finding time for regular workouts can be challenging. However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence and computer vision, innovative solutions are emerging to make fitness more accessible and effective. The AI Virtual Trainer is one such project, leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe to provide real-time exercise tracking and guidance.

# How It Works

The AI Virtual Trainer utilizes the capabilities of OpenCV and MediaPipe to:

* Real-time Pose Estimation: MediaPipe's pose estimation model is employed to detect and track key points on the human body in real-time. These key points serve as the 
  foundation for recognizing and counting various exercises.
* Exercise Recognition: By analyzing the movements of these key points, the AI Virtual Trainer can accurately identify and classify different exercises, including situps, 
  dumbbell curls, pushups, pullups, and jumping jacks.
* Rep Counting: The system counts repetitions of each exercise based on the detected pose patterns and temporal information. It ensures accurate counting by considering the 
  range of motion, speed, and other relevant factors.
